     <div class="middle"><h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Tyrese and I enjoy playing video games.  Such games consist of Call of Duty, Madden, and Destiny.  Even in my spare time I like to go to the gym or even play football with some friends.  Working hard in school is something that I do all the time in order to get good grades and graduate to move onto college.  After that I hope to move on to get a job as a CEO of a gaming company to produce content for people to enjoy.</p>
